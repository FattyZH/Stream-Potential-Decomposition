# A Decomposition from 2D U-V flow field to Stream and Potnetial field
An useful method in 2D Flow field analysis (especially for medium or large scale ocean currents).

This method transform the 2d flow field which described by u and v to the field which consist of Stram-function and Potential-function. Although the decomposition is not unique, we can obtain an unique and physically meaningful flow field by assuming appropriate boundary conditions.
